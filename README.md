The project is a beginner level DevOps project on "Streamlining Deployemnt Pipelines"
The tools used are:
  1. Terraform(for providing deployment environment for the application)
  2. Ansible (for configuring the deployment environment)
  3. Jenkins (for CI/CD Pipeline)
  4. Prometheus and ELK (for Monitoring at the end of deployment)
  5. Docker and Kubernetes(Containerisation and Orchestration)
Terraform allows docker to invoke an ngnix image which is used at the end of pipeline to deploy the application
