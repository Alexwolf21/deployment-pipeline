Repo related to my demonstration on "Streamlining Deployemnt Pipelines"
The tools used are:
  1. Terraform(IaC and provisioning)
  2. Jenkins (for CI/CD Pipeline)
  3. Prometheus and Grafana(for Monitoring at the end of deployment)
  4. Docker(Containerisation)
Terraform allows docker to invoke an ngnix image which is used at the end of pipeline to deploy the application
